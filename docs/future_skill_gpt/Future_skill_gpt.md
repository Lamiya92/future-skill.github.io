## Using the Custom GPT to Create Exercises

When creating exercises or challenges, there are two possible structures:

- With a topic → The exercise or challenge is part of a course and linked to its theory/flow.

- Without a topic → The exercise or challenge stands alone, not connected to any course, and has no associated theory/flow.


### Commands

- Create an exercise or challenge for <topic_name>

  - Provide an explanation of the exercise
  - Add a UI description (or let GPT generate one using the provided samples)

- Create an exercise or challenge without a topic

  - Provide an explanation of the exercise
  - Add a UI description (or let GPT generate one using the provided samples)
