An Exercise is usually aimed at introducing programming concepts or to solve for fun and to challenge yourself.
Exercises have *levels* and in order to complete an exercise, all levels must be solved, which requires receiving a perfect score.
Completing an exercise is often rewarded with *achievements* and *experience* points.

Exercises that have the *Official* tag are either created or endorsed by Future Skill.

## Flow of solving an Exercise

1. When entering an Exercise you will be presented with level 1, and if the graphical canvas is used you will see it in the bottom left-hand corner with Level 1 visible.
If it is your first time using the Editor a tutorial dialoge window will pop up by the Description tab top left - you will notice it has a "Next tip" button.

2. Start by reading the description text in the top left part of the web page.
Here the problem and what you need to do to solve it is presented and any canvas elements are explained.

3. Click the tab "API" in the top left to read about the methods available to you as you write your code and solve the problem.
Each method can be expanded by clicking it.

4. Now choose the language you want to use to solve the Exercise, the language picker is in the top right part of the page.

5. In the Solution tab, below the language picker, you see the code window where an initial starting point for solving the problem is shown.
You can always return to this initial state by using the red Reset code button, top right.
Read through the available methods and their descriptions, as these are also an integral part of understanding the Exercise.

6. Now edit the code and make a first try at a solution.

7. When you want to try out the effects of your code, and check that the code runs without problems, press the "Run code" button below the code editor window.

8. Any problems with syntax or runtime errors will show up in the Console window bottom right.
If you had none of these the Console might be mostly blank, but you will at least see horizontal blue lines and the step numbers to the very right (e.g. 0/2, 1/2, 2/2 if there are two steps).
The "steps" is mostly a concept which has to do with each animation increment in the canvas, but it usually also corresponds to the number of times your methods are called.
For example, in the "Apple Picker" Exercise the "update" is called once, but the animation has a step 0/2 for the initial render and a step 2/2 to show the end result.
Step 1/2 is when your "update" method is called.

9. Continue working on your code until you have solved Level 1.
When this happens the canvas will typically inform you that you have solved the level correctly, and the "Next Level" button top right will be enabled (it will be a solid blue color).
You can also navigate to the next level in the level picker in the top right part of the page.
Now click the "Next Level" button.

10.  Continue solving Level 2, 3 and so forth until you have solved the entire exercise.
You should see a toast window appear in the bottom right of the page highlighting that you were awarded experience points for solving the Exercise.

## Sample Exercises

Get inspiration from existing exercises to see how the features provided by Future Skill are used.

- [Wide Screen](https://futureskill.com/freecode-creator/6668377f8e7fd9a591996e33) – A sample exercise to get started with the basics of interactive programming challenges, including world creation, character movement, and dynamic view rendering. It also introduces per-level settings, speech bubbles, and score tracking.

- [Global Pos](https://futureskill.com/freecode-creator/666835c98e7fd9a591996c70) - A sample exercise to explore visual transformations in interactive programming, including offset, anchor, scale, rotation, and pivot. Learners experiment with how these properties affect UI elements when clicking on the canvas. Ideal for understanding coordinate systems and graphical element manipulation.

- [Reversi](https://futureskill.com/freecode-creator/60ace4a1b705932a147b0686) - A two-player Reversi challenge that teaches turn-based logic, state tracking, and interactive board rendering (Grid). Players implement move strategies, handle flips, and respond to UI interactions with dynamic visuals. Ideal for exploring game rules enforcement, conditional animation, and user-AI gameplay mechanics.

- [World Creator](https://futureskill.com/freecode-creator/667928e88d54121aebab2143) - A multi-level challenge where learners build and validate a 5x5 ecosystem using a custom world grid. It teaches grid manipulation, spatial reasoning, and condition-based logic to populate and animate characters based on environmental rules. Ideal for exploring API design, visual feedback, and dynamic solution evaluation.

- [The Sims](https://futureskill.com/freecode-creator/6687da3b6fd0568ae4ea8204) - A sample exercise to explore advanced usage of tile-based world creation in UI-driven challenges, including character placement, object decoration, and level layout using coordinate systems. Learners build a dynamic, interactive environment with props, walls, and multiple characters, while managing isometric or top-down perspectives. Great for learning spatial reasoning, world graph construction, and programmatic level design in a reactive canvas.

- [Drag & Drop Sample Exercise](https://futureskill.com/freecode-creator/687fc1de1dec4dd59642c832) - A sample exercise to explore drag-and-drop mechanics in a canvas-based UI challenge. Learners interact with draggable shapes and designated drop zones, triggering visual feedback and logic-based validation through event handlers. Ideal for practicing interactive UI behaviors, event-driven programming, and dynamic object manipulation.

- [Data Tables](https://futureskill.com/freecode-creator/66681a878e7fd9a591991ae4) - A sample exercise to explore advanced usage of data tables in UI-based challenges, including formatting, styling, and dynamic updates. Learners work with multiple tables to apply custom data highlighters, cell formatting, and visual feedback like checklists and conditional coloring. Great for learning structured data manipulation and visual representation in a reactive canvas.

- [Inventory](https://futureskill.com/freecode-creator/666836c18e7fd9a591996d5f) - A sample exercise to learn movement logic, path tracking, and environment interaction in an isometric game world. Learners control a character using keyboard input, manage score deductions based on tile types, and interact with items and containers. Useful for exploring real-time feedback, tile-based world design, and basic game mechanics.

- [Complex Shapes](https://futureskill.com/freecode-creator/6668363b8e7fd9a591996d0e) - A visual programming exercise to explore drawing with Bézier curves using ComplexShape. Learners experiment with different path types—linear, quadratic, and cubic—and control properties like color, stroke, and shape closure across levels. Perfect for understanding vector graphics, shape composition, and custom canvas rendering.

- [Keyboard Input](https://futureskill.com/freecode-creator/6880b9ea1dec4dd59643860a) - A sample exercise to explore reactive canvas programming through real-time object manipulation and keyboard-driven interaction. Learners implement movement logic for multiple on-screen objects, respond to key events, and dynamically update object positions within a bounded environment. Ideal for practicing event handling, state management, and interactive UI design. Great for building intuition around animation loops, user input processing, and basic game mechanics in a visual, feedback-rich setting.
